1.what is an XML?
 Xml is a file format just like text, json, HTML e.tc

 <project>
     <message>"heelo world"</message>
 </project>


 an example for json :

 {
    "project":"project1",
    "message":"hello world"

 }

 a text file:

 the project is project1 and the message is hello world;





POM.xml:

<project>
<version> </version>

   <dependencies>


   </dependencies>


</project>


1.Maven project:
simply click on new project
select maven from options
and create a new project with a name

maven porject saves you from hustle of adding dependencies like u do in java project (adding jasrs manually)
in maven you can mention the dependency that u need from maven repo
add it in the POM.xml
reload the project
and it is there for you to use.

    <dependencies>
        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.bonigarcia/webdrivermanager -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.bonigarcia</groupId>
            <artifactId>webdrivermanager</artifactId>
            <version>5.1.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>


--------------------------------------------testNG---------------------------

Test is a tool,
it can be used to unit test, integration test e.t.c
no mian needed if u are working with testNG


Annotations:

1.@Test:
All the test cases must be written down under the annotation of @Test.


whenever u run a class , it is going to execute each and every method under the annotation of
@Test.

by deafult @Test annotation follows alphabetical order of execution of the test cases

e.g public void atestcase(); --> will execute first
    public void btestcase();-->will execute second

    the geeen tick indicates that test case has passed
    the red sign idnicates the test case has failed



@BeforeMethod annotation:

the code under this annotation is going to execute everytime before each and every @Test execution is made



@AfterMethod annotation :

the code under this annotation is going to execute after every test Method (after every @TEST)

1.What is xml?
 Xml is file format

2.How to create a maven project?

file-->new-->project
new Project--> build system (maven)


3.POM.XML?
 it is an XML file

 we can add our dependencies here for the project


4.In POM.xml how do i ad dependencies?

<dependencies>
       <dependency>
             <groupID>Selenium.org</groupID>
             <artifactId> selenium-java </artifactid>
             <version>3.15.7</version>
       </dependency>

        <dependency>


       </dependency>

</dependencies>



5.What are the annotations?

a.@Test --> all the test cases are written in this annotation


b.@BeforeMethod--> this runs before every @Test annotation    -->Pre-Condtions

c. @AfterMethod -->  this will run after each @Test annotaion  -->Post--condition


6. what is the purpose of enable disable?

@Test(enabled=false)  --> it will not run this test case  --> we might use this if we want to not run a test case

7.Depends on what is the purpose?

@Test(dependsOnMethods ={"login"})   --> this test case depends on login and will be only executed if Login  "Passes";



8.Priority?

By default the priority is 0 --> highest order

if two cases are there with 0 priority --> aphabetically ascending will be followed

@Test(priority =3)
ABC
@Test(priority =1)
DEF
@Test(priority =2)
GHI

what will be the execution order of these test cases

DEF
GHI
ABC
