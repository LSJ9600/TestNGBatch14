TestNg -
TestNG is a tool used to perform unit and integration testing.

Data driven testing -
when one Test cases executes against multiple set of data, we call it data driven testing

Annotation-
@Test - it is a chief annotation of testng and every TC starts with it.
By default it follows alphabetical order for execution.

@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod

@BeforeClass
@AfterClass

= if else statement's use in java/selenium

Verification vs Validation
Verification - checking the existence
Validation - checking the correctness of the field after existence

Assertions in TestNg

Hard assertion
Soft assertion

Hard Assertion
Whenever assertion fails in hard assertion - it will stop the execution.

Soft assertion -
it allows us to have multiple verification and validation checkpoints
if assertions fails in between, still it allows us to execute the code till the last
and will give the consolidated report
